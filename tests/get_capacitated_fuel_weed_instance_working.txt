Trying to solve the BOPMid instance (500+ customers) with distance matrix, minimizing total distances with a demand capacity constraint + route distance constraint.
This is  a log of command line inputs and outputs.
Each subsequent program is a duplicate of the previous, with some changes.

We begin with Capacitated_Weed_instance_n18.cc and modify to add a distance constriant.

Weed instance (n18) with 10 vehicles, 5 demand capacity each, 10000000 (100,000m) distance capacity.
routing.AddDimension(
    transit_callback_index,    // transit callback index
    int64{0},                 // null capacity slack
    10000000,//data.vehicle_distance_capacities,  // vehicle maximum distance capacities
    true,                     // start cumul to zero
    "Distance");

How about we reduce the distance limit to slightly under the current longest route?
Weed instance (n18), Savings, 1 solution limit, distance limit 1400000 (14,000m).

It reduced the max route distance, but increased the total distance of all routes massively.
Okay, let's incrementally reduce the distance limit, until solution uses another vehicle.

Savings, 1 solution limit, distance limit 1300000 (13,000m).
C:\Users\jc321076\github\or-tools>mingw32-make run SOURCE=tests/Capacitated_Fuel_Weed_instance_n18.cc
Unhandled exception at 0x00007FF7DEE81ECF in Capacitated_Fuel_Weed_instance_n18.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x0000000000000010. occurred

Hm. Is it because it can't fine a solution?
Possible reasons:
A) there is a node that is more than 13,000m from the depot
 - Plot nodes
B) Demand capacity and distance limit clashes in a way that doesn't allow for vehicles to return to depot under-capacity?
